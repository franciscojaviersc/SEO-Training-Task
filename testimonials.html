                    Not because it's a groundbreaking new invention, or because it can literally make your hair see invisible kittens that nobody else can see.<br> 
                    No, I love it because this allows me to troll my hair with electrical fields, and there's nothing that makes me feel more like a real electrical engineer than giving my hair an electrostatic charge.<br>
                    Now, some experts say that I don't technically have control over my hair, and that it's merely following the laws of physics, and therefore this may not actually be within my control.<br>
                    But screw them, because I feel like they're the anti-hair-trolls, and I'm trying to put myself in a position where I can have complete control over the styling of my hair, and what better way to do that than by electrifying it?
