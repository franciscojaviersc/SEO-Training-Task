                    Sprayfixoright lets you turn your hair into a giant, static electrical conductor. By rubbing it against your head, you build up an electrostatic charge. By raising and lowering your charged head, you generate an electrostatic field. This field, if large enough, can deflect the path of a laser beam, or knock over objects.<br>
                    This product would be useful for scientists and lab technicians, who can use it to deflect laser beams, or to knock over test tubes. It would also be useful for students, who could use it to move their notes, or to repel their friends.
